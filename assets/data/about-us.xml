        <title>Our Vision</title>

        <paragraph>
            <text>Over time, the percentage of people experiencing the overarching ramifications of mental ill-health
has increased drastically and the World Federation for Mental Health has predicted that the future
will witness a greater increase in the same. Unfortunately, however, only half of those who struggle
with mental ill-health get to avail professional help due to the strong stigma that surrounds mental
malaise or any discussion regarding the same. Medical and first-hand research drives have indicated
that even a minor mental illness, if untreated, could eventually result in a greater psychological
impact and become detrimental to physical health.</text>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
            <text>We, at Mind.You, believe that there is a pressing
need to initiate candid and unhindered conversations about mental health, with all its linked stigma
and misconceptions, and bring about an enduring change in the way people tend to view mental ill-
health and its treatment. Our efforts are therefore primarily directed towards raising public
awareness and launching fundraising campaigns to bridge the gap between financial inaccessibility
and mental health-care facilities.</text>
